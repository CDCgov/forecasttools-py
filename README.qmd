Summary of `forecasttools-py`:

* A Python package.
* Primarily supports the Short Term Forecast's team.
* Intended to support wider Real Time Monitoring branch operations.
* Has tools for pre- and post-processing.
  * Conversion of `az.InferenceData` forecast to Hubverse format.
  * Addition of time and or dates to `az.InferenceData`.

Notes:

* _This repository is a WORK IN PROGRESS._


# Installation

Install `forecasttools` via:

```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/CDCgov/forecasttools-py@main
```

# Vignettes

* Format Arviz Forecast Output For FluSight Submission (In Progress)

# Datasets

```{python}
import forecasttools
```

`forecasttools` contains several datasets. These datasets aid with experimentation or are directly necessary to some of `forecasttools` utilities.

## Location Table

The location table contains abbreviations, codes, and extended names for the US jurisdictions for which the FluSight and COVID forecasting hubs require users to generate forecasts.

```{python}
forecasttools.location_table
```

The location table is stored in `forecasttools` as a `polars` dataframe and is accessed via:

```python
import forecasttools
loc_table = forecasttools.location_table
```

Using `data.py`, the location table was created by running the following:

```python
make_census_dataset(
    file_save_path=os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "location_table.csv"),
)
```

## Example FluSight Hub Submission

The example FluSight submission comes from the [following 2023-24 submission](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cdcepi/FluSight-forecast-hub/main/model-output/cfa-flumech/2023-10-14-cfa-flumech.csv).

The example FluSight submission is stored in `forecasttools` as a `polars` dataframe and is accessed via:

```python
import forecasttools
submission = forecasttools.example_flusight_submission
```

Using `data.py`, the example FluSight submission was created by running the following:

```python
get_and_save_flusight_submission(
    file_save_path=os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "example_flusight_submission.csv"),
)
```


## NHSN COVID And Flu Hospital Admissions

Hospital admissions data for fitting from NHSN for COVID and Flu is included in `forecasttools` as well, for user experimentation. This data is current as of `2024-04-27` and comes from the website [HealthData.gov COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State Timeseries](https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/g62h-syeh). For influenza, the `previous_day_admission_influenza_confirmed` column is retained and for COVID the `previous_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed` column is retained. As can be seen in the example below, some early dates for each jurisdiction do not have data.

Shape: (81_713, 3)

| state | date       | hosp |
| ---   | ---        | ---  |
| str   | str        | str  |

| AK    | 2020-03-25 | null |
| AK    | 2020-03-26 | null |
| AK    | 2020-03-27 | null |
| AK    | 2020-03-28 | null |
| AK    | 2020-03-29 | null |
| AK    | 2020-03-30 | null |
| …    | …         | …   |

| WY    | 2024-04-26 | 0    |
| WY    | 2024-04-27 | 0    |


The fitting data is stored in `forecasttools` as a `polars` dataframe and is accessed via:

```python
import forecasttools


# access COVID data
covid_nhsn_data = forecasttools.nhsn_hosp_COVID

# access flu data
flu_nhsn_data = forecasttools.nhsn_hosp_flu
```

The data was created by placing a csv file called `NHSN_RAW_20240926.csv` (the full NHSN dataset) into `./forecasttools` and running, in `data.py`, the following:

```python
# generate COVID dataset
make_nshn_fitting_dataset(
    dataset="COVID",
    nhsn_dataset_path="NHSN_RAW_20240926.csv",
    file_save_path=os.path.join(os.getcwd(),"nhsn_hosp_COVID.csv")
)

# generate flu dataset
make_nshn_fitting_dataset(
    dataset="flu",
    nhsn_dataset_path="NHSN_RAW_20240926.csv",
    file_save_path=os.path.join(os.getcwd(),"nhsn_hosp_flu.csv")
)
```

## Influenza Hospitalizations Forecast(s)

Two example forecasts stored in Arviz `InferenceData` objects are included for vignettes and user experimentation. Both are 28 day influenza hospital admissions forecasts for Texas made using a spline regression model fitted to NHSN data between 2022-08-08 and 2022-12-08. The only difference between the forecasts is that `example_flu_forecast_w_dates.nc` has dates as its coordinates. The `idata` objects which includes the observed data and posterior predictive samples is given below:

```
Inference data with groups:
	> posterior
	> posterior_predictive
	> log_likelihood
	> sample_stats
	> prior
	> prior_predictive
	> observed_data
```

The forecast `idata`s are accessed via:

```python
import forecasttools


# idata with dates as coordinates
idata_w_dates = forecasttools.nhsn_flu_forecast_w_dates

# idata without dates as coordinates
idata_wo_dates = forecasttools.nhsn_flu_forecast_wo_dates
```

The forecast was generated following the creation of `nhsn_hosp_flu.csv` (see previous section) by running `data.py` with the following added:

```python
make_forecast(
    nhsn_data=forecasttools.nhsn_hosp_flu,
    start_date="2022-08-08",
    end_date="2022-12-08",
    juris_subset=["TX"],
    forecast_days=28,
    save_path="../forecasttools/example_flu_forecast_w_dates.nc",
    save_idata=True,
    use_log=False,
)
```

The forecast looks like:
